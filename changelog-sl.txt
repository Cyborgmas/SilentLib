Considering that Silent Lib is entirely behind-the-scenes from the player's perspective, this changelog likely won't mean much to most readers. You have been warned! Or something like that.

1.2.0
Fixed: Forge blockstate JSON's not working properly.

1.1.0
Fixed an issue with entity renderer registration.
Modified SRegistry to use generics for block/item registry.
