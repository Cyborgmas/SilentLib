Considering that Silent Lib is entirely behind-the-scenes from the player's perspective, this changelog likely won't mean much to most readers. You have been warned! Or something like that.

2.1.4
Added: Safe method for spawning entities from other threads (EntityHelper#safeSpawn)
Added: Left-click (empty/block) handlers for items. These can capture left-clicks on the client and send a packet to the server for processing.

2.1.3
Added: EntityHelper#getEntityNameList to fix a Silent's Gems issue.
Fixed: The "quote guy" not being cleared properly (guide book main page)

2.1.2
Fixed: Buggy enchantments causing a crash (Good ol' PvP's silliness, for example)

2.1.1
Added: Implemented config/achievement buttons in guide book.
Added: Implemented quotes in guide book.
Fixed: [1.10.2] Missing localizations caused by the resources folder having the wrong structure.

2.1.0
Added: A guide book system. It is heavily inspired by (and partially copied from) Actually Additions. Any mod should be able to easily(?) create a decent guide book with this.
Note on the guide book system: This was introduced because Silent's Gems was using Guide-API, which does not work across Minecraft versions. An alternative solution might have been to add a Guide-API adaptor system into Lib, but this is probably for the best.

2.0.6
Added: Minecraft version getter
Added: SyncVariable interface. Allows tile entities to sync data with less code.
Changed: Improved CreativeTabSL, making it less likely to self-destruct in 1.10.2.

2.0.5
Added: KeyTrackerSL, a base class for key trackers
Added: WorldHelper (needed for a Gems bugfix)

2.0.4
Added: ItemHelper (needed for a Gems bugfix)

2.0.3
Fixed: Custom recipes not consuming ingredients.
Fixed: Some containers not dropping their inventories (eg Gems' material grader)

2.0.2
Added: BiomeHelper (fix for a Fun Ores issue in 1.10.2)

2.0.1
~

2.0.0-37
Fixes the armor constructor.

2.0.0-36
First XCompat build

1.2.0
Added: An adaptive config system inspired by Botania's. Still needs a bit of work, but functions for some values.
Fixed: Forge blockstate JSONs not loading properly. This may prevent some models from existing mods from loading properly. It also creates a bit of log spam on load about missing models that I haven't figured out, but that doesn't hurt anything.

1.1.0
Fixed an issue with entity renderer registration.
Modified SRegistry to use generics for block/item registry.
