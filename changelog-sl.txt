Considering that Silent Lib is entirely behind-the-scenes from the player's perspective, this changelog likely won't mean much to most readers. You have been warned! Or something like that.

2.0.3
Fixed: Custom recipes not consuming ingredients.

2.0.2
Added: BiomeHelper (fix for a Fun Ores issue in 1.10.2)

2.0.1
~

2.0.0-37
Fixes the armor constructor.

2.0.0-36
First XCompat build

1.2.0
Added: An adaptive config system inspired by Botania's. Still needs a bit of work, but functions for some values.
Fixed: Forge blockstate JSONs not loading properly. This may prevent some models from existing mods from loading properly. It also creates a bit of log spam on load about missing models that I haven't figured out, but that doesn't hurt anything.

1.1.0
Fixed an issue with entity renderer registration.
Modified SRegistry to use generics for block/item registry.
